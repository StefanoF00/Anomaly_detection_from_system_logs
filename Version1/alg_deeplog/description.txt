DEEPLOG DEFINITION:
DeepLog is a deep neural network that models a sequence of log entries (dataset HDFS) 
using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, an instance of RNNs that has the ability
to remember long-term dependencies over sequences. LSTMs have demonstrated success in 
various tasks such as machine translation, sentiment analysis and medical self-diagnosis.

HDFS DATASET:
Dataset containing real logs from a 203-node Hadoop installation on Amazon's EC2 cloud computing environment

PARSING MESSAGES:
printed messages are converted into key values, eg:
    'Deletion of file * complete' -> k1
    'took * seconds to deallocate network' -> k2
    ...

WINDOW SIZE h:
is the number of recent log keys over which deeplog updates model.
In fact the new key log value depends on the last keys and a correct
choice of h is important. eg:
    sequeince = {k22, k5, k11, k9, k11, k26};
    window size h = 3;
    input sequence and the output label pairs to train DeepLog will be: 
    {k22, k5, k11 → k9}, {k5, k11, k9 → k11}, {k11, k9, k11 → k26}.

DEEPLOG ALGORITHM:
consider K = set of keys;
consider mt = value of a key in position t in a log key sequence
input:  h most recent keys
output: sorted probability for each log key to appear as next given h
    Pr[ mt= ki in K |h] = {k1 : p1, k2 : p2, ..., kn : pn }, p1>p2>...pk-1>pk

DETECTION ANOMALIES:
Consider new key value kt as normal if it'is among the g most 
probable candidates in Pr[mt= ki in K |h]. Else, it is abnormal
